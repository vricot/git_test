<p> My name is Valerie Ricot and I am both a creative and a logical thinker.
    My background is in Entertainment (I have a B.S. in Film/TV from Boston University
    and have illustration/animation experience using Adobe among a variety of other programs. 
    Link to some of my work <a href="#">here</a>) yet I was also very involved in STEM in 
    high school through early college. I am happy to have finally found a medium where I can be both.</p>
    <h3>Three of my favorite things include:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Ramen & bubble tea. Food in general.</li>
    <li>The smell of coffee shops and libraries/bookstores.</li>
